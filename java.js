var Fifth = Numbr.slice(5);

console.log(Fifth);

//3. Delete the last number in the array that you created above.

delete Numbr[9];

console.log(Numbr)

var mapObj = {
    Strawberries:"Bananas",
    strawberries:"bananas",

};
originalString = originalString.replace(/Strawberries|strawberries|strawberry/gi, function(matched){return mapObj [matched];})    
console.log(originalString);
}

fruitSwitch();

//5. Create an array and a button. The array should contain 4 football clubs names. When the button is clicked, remove all elements out of the array that we just created. There after add in 4 names of cars inside that array. Log it to the console.

var myArray = ['Bod√∏', 'Brann', 'Rosenborg', 'Viking'];

function swapArray (myArray) {
    myArray = [];
    console.log(myArray);
    myArray = ['Chevy Impala1a', 'Ford Mustang', 'Dodge Charger', 'Buick GNX'];
    console.log(myArray);
}


//6. Create an array of objects with 3 people inside it. Use the filter function to map by a name.

var Peeps = [

    },
    {
        name: "Doomguy",

   var d = new Date()
   var n = d.getDate();

logDate();
